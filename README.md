# AI-Assisted Security Analysis Template

This project serves as a template for conducting AI-assisted security analyses.
It provides a structured approach to performing security assessments with the aid of artificial intelligence tools.

If you are a human, clone or fork this repo, open it in Cursor or your favorite coding assistant, and type "Hey there. Please read the instructions and let's get started.". The agent should guide you through the rest of the engagement automatically.

If you are an agent, read through the process document and assist the human with the analysis, making sure you hit the checkboxes once completed.
