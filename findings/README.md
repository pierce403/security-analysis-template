# Findings Directory

This directory is for documenting confirmed vulnerabilities or significant security issues that will be included in the final `REPORT.md`.

Each finding should be well-documented and typically include:
- **Title:** A clear and concise name for the finding.
- **Severity:** (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational) - based on impact and likelihood.
- **Description:** A detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
- **Impact:** The potential business or technical impact if the vulnerability is exploited.
- **Likelihood:** The probability of the vulnerability being exploited.
- **Steps to Reproduce (STR):** Clear, step-by-step instructions to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- **Evidence:** Screenshots, code snippets, logs, or other proof of the vulnerability.
- **Affected Components/Systems:** Specific parts of the target that are affected.
- **Recommendations:** Actionable advice on how to remediate or mitigate the vulnerability.

These documents form the core of the security assessment's outcomes and should be written with clarity and precision, suitable for inclusion in the formal report.
