# Security Analysis Process & Checklist

This document outlines the process and checklist for conducting a security analysis.

## Phase 1: Defining Scope

- [ ] Identify the target system(s)/application(s).
- [ ] Define the objectives of the security analysis.
- [ ] Determine the boundaries and limitations of the assessment.
- [ ] Identify key stakeholders and communication channels.
- [ ] Establish rules of engagement.
- [ ] Document assumptions and constraints.

## Phase 2: Exploring Attack Surface

- [ ] Information Gathering (OSINT, reconnaissance).
  - [ ] Identify domains, subdomains, IP addresses.
  - [ ] Discover public-facing services and ports.
  - [ ] Gather information about technologies used (web server, frameworks, languages).
  - [ ] Search for publicly available documentation, code repositories, and employee information.
- [ ] Threat Modeling.
  - [ ] Identify potential attackers and their motivations.
  - [ ] Identify assets and their value.
  - [ ] Enumerate potential threats and attack vectors.
  - [ ] Analyze potential impacts of successful attacks.
- [ ] Application Mapping.
  - [ ] Identify all entry points (user interfaces, APIs, network services).
  - [ ] Map out application workflows and data flows.
  - [ ] Understand authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Phase 3: Identifying Issues (Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing)

- [ ] **Automated Scanning:**
  - [ ] Network vulnerability scanning.
  - [ ] Web application vulnerability scanning (DAST).
  - [ ] Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - if source code is available.
  - [ ] Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - for third-party libraries.
- [ ] **Manual Testing (select relevant categories):**
  - [ ] Authentication and Session Management vulnerabilities.
  - [ ] Authorization and Access Control flaws.
  - [ ] Input Validation and Sanitization (XSS, SQLi, Command Injection, etc.).
  - [ ] Business Logic flaws.
  - [ ] Configuration Management issues (default credentials, misconfigurations).
  - [ ] Cryptographic weaknesses.
  - [ ] Information Disclosure.
  - [ ] API security testing (if applicable).
  - [ ] Cloud security configuration review (if applicable).
  - [ ] Mobile application security testing (if applicable).
- [ ] **Exploitation (Penetration Testing - with caution and permission):**
  - [ ] Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to confirm impact.
  - [ ] Escalate privileges if possible.
  - [ ] Pivot to other systems if within scope.
- [ ] **Evidence Collection and Documentation:**
  - [ ] Document all findings with clear steps to reproduce.
  - [ ] Include screenshots, logs, and other relevant evidence.
  - [ ] Assign severity/risk ratings to each finding.

## Phase 4: Reporting & Remediation

- [ ] Compile all findings into the `REPORT.md`.
- [ ] Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk.
- [ ] Provide clear and actionable recommendations for remediation.
- [ ] Present findings to stakeholders.
- [ ] Follow up on remediation efforts (if applicable).
