# Observations Directory

This directory is for recording interesting observations, potential areas of concern, or anything noteworthy discovered during the security analysis that warrants further exploration.

Think of this as a scratchpad or a log of things that catch your eye but haven't yet been fully investigated or confirmed as vulnerabilities.

## Purpose:
- To keep track of items that need to be circled back to.
- To note down anomalies or unexpected behavior.
- To brainstorm potential attack paths based on initial findings.

Files in this directory are typically informal and for internal team use during the assessment. They may or may not lead to formal findings.
